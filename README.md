I developed a Brain Tumor Classification project achieving 98% accuracy using a custom CNN model. The 4-class dataset classified tumors into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. The model was fine-tuned for optimal performance, showcasing expertise in deep learning and its application in medical diagnostics.
